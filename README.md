Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set
On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
  There were outliers in the data with 5 digit values from stores 42 and 78. Therefore all the 5 digit values should be removed. To calculate the new average I removed all the outliers from the order value column got the sum of all remaining values. I then divided the sum by 4937 records that were then present.   

b.What metric would you report for this dataset?
I would report it as Average Small Order Value

c. What is its value?
I got a value of 302.58
